# ConcatenatOR
### Description

This simple Chrome extension takes a column of strings, adds the boolean operator " OR " between them and copies the resulting string to the clipboard.
The string can then be pasted into the search bar in ArchivesSpace to isolate a group of titles, identifiers, or other criteria. 
This works well in the filter search bar of the Accessions module and in the Manage Top Containers module. 
When used in the Manage Top Containers module, the search results can easily be bulk edited in various ways.

### Installation

- Download the entire ConcatonatOR folder containing the extension files and move it to your location of choice.
- Go to chrome://extensions/ in Chrome, or select "Manage Extensions" from the menu.
- Click the button in the upper right to enable "Developer Mode" and then click the button on the upper left titled "Load unpacked." 
- Select the downloaded ConcatonatOR folder and if all goes well, the extension will appear there among your others. 
- The extension interface can be accessed in the drop down menu of the puzzle shaped extensions icon to the right of the browser's search bar.

### Use
- Select and copy a group of search strings that are separated by line breaks/they each occupy a row in a column of a table
      Example:
      5489
      1274
      13902
      10006
  - Alternately, the strings can be typed directly into the text input box of the extension
- Open the extension, paste the search strings into the text input box and click OK
  - The new concatonated string will then be copied to the clipboard
- Navigate to an ArchivesSpace search bar and use command/control V to paste the new string into it.
