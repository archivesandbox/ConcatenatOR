# ConcatenatOR
### Description

This simple Chrome extension takes a column of strings, adds the boolean operator " OR " between them and copies the resulting string to the clipboard.
The string can then be pasted into the search bar in ArchivesSpace to isolate a group of titles, identifiers, or other criteria. 
This works well in the filter search bar in the Accessions module and in the Manage Top Containers module. 
When used in Manage Top Containers, the search results can easily be bulk edited in various ways.

### Installation

- Download the entire ConcatonatOR folder containing the file and move it to your location of choice.
- Go to chrome://extensions/ in Chrome, or select "Manage Extensions" from the menu.
- Click the button in the upper right to enable "Developer Mode" and then click the button on the upper left titled "Load unpacked." 
- Select the downloaded folder and if all goes well, the extension will appear there among your others. 
- The extension interface can be accessed in the drop down menu of the puzzle shaped extensions icon to the right of the browser's search bar.
