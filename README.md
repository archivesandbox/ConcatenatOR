# ConcatenatOR
A small Chrome extension that takes a column of strings, adds " OR " between them and copies the resulting string to the clipboard.
This string can then be pasted into the search bar in ArchivesSpace to isolate a group of titles, identifiers, or other criteria. This works well in the filter search bar for the Accessions module and for the Manage Top Containers module. 

When used in Manage Top Containers, the search results can easily be bulk edited in various ways.

To install, download the entire folder containing the files. Go to chrome://extensions/ in Chrome, or select "Manage Extensions" from the menu.
Click the button in the upper right to enable "Developer Mode" and then click the button on the upper left titled "Load unpacked." Select the downloaded folder and if all goes well, the extension will appear there among your others. 
The extension interface can be accessed through the puzzle shaped icon to the right of the search bar at the top.
